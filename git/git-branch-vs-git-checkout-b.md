# git branch vs git checkout -b

When creating a new branch, you can use `git branch` but also `git checkout -b`, the difference is as follows:

## git branch:

`git branch BRANCH_NAME` creates a new branch but leaves you on the same branch.

## git checkout -b:

`git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` creates a new branch and checks out the new branch.
